# GitFollower
A cool and non-spammy bot that lives for the sole purpose of acquiring you new GitHub followers! - Java

## Why GitFollower ?
>To satisfy my curiosity. What would happen if i recursively treverse friends, friends of friends, friends of friends of friends...so on - And add only those who have a followers to following ratio of (X:Y) [that is an account that's percentage% likely to follow it's followers] ?

>**What if we follow only accounts that follow all it's followers ?** What would happen if we **unfollow** them afterwords ? *oops!*

## Of Course
>Of course there are more variables that this naive simplification. But it'd be cool to see what happens!
