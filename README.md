GreedyGit is a GitBot that utilizes the GitHub's api to do cool things. 
At this stage, the GreedyGit is only capable of 

##**_helping you increase your follower count!!_** 

#How does GreedyGit aquire followers ?
While the best way to aquire followers is to create something really cool or contribute to other projects, GreedyGit is a neat little tool. The principal behind GreedyGit is **reciprocity**. People you follow are likely to follow you back. 

Suppose your friend *Lucy* has 412 followers and you want a piece of the action. You will specify Lucy as the 'target' and GreedyGit will automatically follow all 412 followers of Lucy. Not only can GG (GreedyGit) grab Lucy's followers, but she can also grab their followers, and followers of their followers, and so on....
